This directory contains scripts for generating figures for the
paper "Vertical structure of baroclinic instability in a three-layer
quasi-geostrophic model over a sloping bottom".

Data required to generate Figures 7 and 8 can either be generated
from simulation output, or received directly by emailing mattlobo@princeton.edu.
